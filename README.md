# Business Analytics Dashboard with Streamlit and Plotly

I developed a comprehensive Business Analytics Dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly, designed to provide deep insights into customer data. The dashboard features interactive visualizations including pie charts, donut charts, bar charts, and scatter plots, all dynamically generated based on user-selected filters for departments, countries, and business units.

**Key Features:**

- **Filtering Options:** Users can filter data by department, country, and business unit using sidebar controls.
- **Visual Analytics:** Includes visualizations like pie charts for customer distribution by city, donut charts for departmental breakdowns, and bar charts for salary comparisons across job titles.
- **Interactive Tables:** Displays detailed customer data with customizable column views.
- **Statistical Insights:** Provides metrics such as total customers, total annual salary, and salary ranges dynamically updated based on filter selections.

This project showcases my skills in Python, Pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit, highlighting my ability to create intuitive data-driven applications for business insights.
